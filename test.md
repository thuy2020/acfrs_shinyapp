This study covers three topics. First, it inventories the main categories of government liabilities, including examples of governments that have accumulated large amounts of these debts. Then it reviews selected governments that have large total liabilities relative to their annua revenues. Finally, the study contains a discussion of data collection and reporting challenges, offering policy changes that would enable oversight bodies, analysts, and active citizens to track liabilities being accumulated by governments with which they are concerned.
